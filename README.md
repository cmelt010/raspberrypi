# Garage Temperature & Humidity Logger

This project uses a Raspberry Pi with a DHT22 sensor to record temperature and humidity data over time.  
The Python script collects the sensor readings, logs them to a CSV file, and the data is visualized in Power BI (included as a PDF export for easy viewing).
